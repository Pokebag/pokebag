# Patch 1.1.1.6 Released

That's right, [Pok√©mon UNITE](/unite)'s second major patch was released early this morning! With it came bug fixes, rebalancing, and a new Pok√©mon champion!

## Who's the new champ?

**Blissey has joined the fight!** Blissey comes in as a support Pok√©mon (no surprise there) with solid heals and some pretty gnarly buffs! Check out the promo video on YouTube.

## Who won the rebalance?

It's _really_ hard to say...

* Late game Gardevoir got a massive buff ‚Äî possibly a bug ‚Äî to Psychic: it now _completely removes all Special Defense from the target. ü§Ø
* Crustle got major buffs to both of its special attacks, making it scarier than ever.
* Greninja also got a buff. Why? Who tf knows.

It remains to be seen which mon really won the rebalance, but I'd be willing to bet it's Crustle.

On the flip side, Snorlax and Slowbro both got shafted:
* This patch wasn't the massive nerf for Snorlax that many expected, but it did receive nerfs to both Heavy Slam and Block. Maybe we'll see more Snorlaxes using Yawn and Flail as a result! ü•≥
* Slowbro's Surf has been its one saving grace since launch. This patch reduced the stun of each Surf wave, though, so victims can act between waves. Scald got a buff, though, so maybe it'll make the alternative moveset more viable. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

## Can I make Snorlax look like a berry?

You most certainly can, and it's _wonderful_... though it's only available as an energy reward. Eldegoss and Pikachu also got new "Fashionable Style" holowear.
